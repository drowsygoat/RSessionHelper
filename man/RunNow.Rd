\description{
This function submits the currently running R script to a Slurm-managed cluster.
It uses a predefined Slurm script (`runSmoothR.sh`) assumed to be available in the system's PATH.
The function automatically retrieves the name of the running script and submits it to Slurm,
which makes the script handling secure and error-free. Also, a function (`ActivateSmoothR())` will copy `runSmoothR.sh` to your folder of choice (profided ar argument), and add the route to it to your $PATH variable by updatin "~/.bashrc", or ~/.zshrc
}
\examples{
# Submit the currently running script to Slurm, outputting to the console
